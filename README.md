📉 Customer Churn Analysis – End-to-End Data Analytics Solution

📌 Project Overview

This project delivers an end-to-end customer churn analytics workflow designed to help businesses identify, understand, and reduce customer attrition. Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for data exploration and Power BI for dashboard creation, the solution uncovers churn patterns, highlights risk factors, and provides data-driven recommendations for retention strategies.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer churn trends and behavior.

Identify key drivers contributing to churn.

Build visual dashboards for stakeholder decision-making.

Recommend strategies to reduce churn rates.
